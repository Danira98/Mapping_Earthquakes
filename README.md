# Mapping Earthquakes: Working with GeoJSON

## Overview of Project
 In this project, we are instructed to visually show the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world of the last seven days. We used URLs for GeoJSON earthquake data from the USGS website, and retrieved the geographical coordinates and magnitudes of the earthquakes in the last seven days. Then, we added the data to a map and allowed the user to interact with the map by providing them the following options:
 
 Design of Map:
 
 - Streets
 - Satellite
 - Navigation Night
 
 Earthquakes:
 
 - Earthquakes
 - Tectonic Plates
 - Major Earthquakes
 
 The user will get to pick which design of map they want to use and which earthquakes they want to look at.

## Results

These are some of the examples the user can get based on the options they pick
